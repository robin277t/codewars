Create a program, which, given a 5 character string as a target word, and a 5 character string as a guess, return a 5 character string where:

‘2’ = this letter is in this position
‘1’ = this letter is in the target word but not this position
‘0’ = this letter is either not in the target word, or is not in the target word as many times as it is in the guess

TEST CASE 1:
target word = "watch"
test word = "words"
=> should return "20000"
